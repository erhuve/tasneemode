	On March 17th, 2023, I answered a math question from a pretty girl. A math question turned to geography, and literature, and music, and overall a really pleasant time. The vibes were immaculate and you were fun and easy to talk to, we bounced off each other well. I had plans that day I needed to attend, I said I had to go but I’d be back. I guess usually that means never talking again in the dating app world, but I meant it that I’d be back, I wanted to be back and keep talking with you and start to learn more about you. 
<br><br>
“What brings you to Hinge?” I asked. You were just messing around, I wasn’t really looking for anything either. From our conversation though I had an inkling of a feeling, that maybe I had just found something. A premonition, maybe. That Japanese phrase, “koi no yokan.” There’s no BS here, I felt that there might be something, that we might go somewhere. At the same time, I guess you could say I was trying to have commitment issues? I had been stupid and thoughtless before and I had let myself get hurt before, and I tried to stay steadfast that I wasn’t looking for anything right now. But I had a feeling that I at least might develop feelings.
<br><br>
We talked more and more, soon we were talking every day. Raccoon memes, talks of throwing me into a dumpster, favorite colors, favorite flowers, spotify, random stuff. It was fun and it was easy and it was nice. One day I get on a call with you to make you do your homework. I refused to turn my camera on because I was embarrassed by my messy room where I had to sit on the floor. I was also rightfully embarrassed by my living situation in general so I had tried to get ahead of it with humor, “you wanna know some tea!!” Cover up the pain. Anyways, we called again the next day and ended up having an 8 hour call including 100 buzzfeed quizzes where we found that we were actually quite alike, at least according to buzzfeed.
