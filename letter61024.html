                  Dear Neemo,
                </strong>
                <p>
pink paper fell from the sky like light snow, and there you stood in the perfect light with your perfect eyes. framed by hundreds of confetti kisses your face beamed and you shone brighter than the stage. a million memories flashed before my eyes but melded into one, an image of love and not just my own. i couldn't take a picture but i burned it in the retina of my eye, and i revisit it from time to time.
<br><br>
i felt your love and it reminded me of how lovely you just are even without me. you remind me of love and everything i love reminds me of you, and everything i love is you. 
<br><br>
it hit me a week later that weeks earlier the world almost lost you. that i almost lost my world. fuck. fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. 
<br><br>
i cant describe it. i dont know if its like the nothing feeling real thing... or if its more like wow this is real, or something else. its definitely more nuanced and complicated. you and all your love are still here and i must hold onto you and it forever.
<br><br>
you said you call me cute because youre incapable or shy of telling me how you really feel. im incapable too of telling you how i feel, so i just cry. 
                </p>

                Love, Remi
