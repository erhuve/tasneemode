                  Dear Neemo,
                </strong>
                <p>
i saw a red cardinal on the way there, and I actually didn't realize they're common cuz I don't think I ever really saw them before, I also mistakenly thought it was a robin like I think of bluejays or whatever, but I saw it and it told me everything would be okay. and i always know it'll be okay with us but it like spoke to me that it would be okay and I got some comfort from it. it was a vibrant red.
<br><br>
red like your lips that i wanted to see, but i couldnt bear to show my face to you.
<br><br>
red like the cranberry juice you bought for me. of course you would get me juice still.
<br><br>
red like the red on the peculiar red and green honda that just parked on the street. the colors of the bangladeshi flag. and we sat near a banner with bangla written on it. the only word i could read, "amader."
<br><br>
"Our."
<br><br>
red like the scooter of the little boy riding by, and when his older sister fell off her scooter but landed on her feet, he asked "are you okay?" and i smiled and teared up because i just saw ara and ali, and i saw Our future where we and our children play in the sun, and we can think it was all worth it.
<br><br>
and then i thought, it already is.
<br><br>
and i spent the rest of the time trying to muster up something to face you and look you in the eye and tell you something anything to convey it
<br><br>
and the cardinal was right, that it'd be okay, and I'm glad to have found out now that I saw a cardinal not a robin and that cardinals are common, cuz that means it always will be okay if they're common
<br><br>
and i love you
                </p>
