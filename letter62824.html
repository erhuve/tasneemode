                  Dear Neemo,
                </strong>
                <p>
                  sometimes it feels like i only know 5 words: <span class="red">I'm sorry. I love you.</span> <br/><br/>

i think i say these a lot, and i wish i were better at stringing together more detailed words. <br/><br/>

sometimes i think about if i say "i love you" too much. like if it diminishes the meaning if im always saying it. (so i try to say it and show it in other ways too). you've told me before you dont think it does. I'll trust you on that. but i do sometimes think maybe it would be more powerful when i say it if i didnt say it as much. i wouldnt want you to get tired of hearing it.
<br/><br/>
i say I'm sorry a lot and I'm sure youre tired of hearing that. sorry. but i say it a lot because i am. I'm sorry i couldnt be here sooner and I'm sorry we missed out on more years more time together. i love you so much and I'm sorry i cant translate all that into a life for you though i try my best. 
<br/><br/>
i know you dont like to see me cry but sometimes i think i need to. we both know I'm a crybaby but its not that simple. for a long time i have been unfeeling, numb, broken, the inside of my mind a meaningless, buzzing swarm of nothing. but i can feel again with you and i feel deep, deep love and i weep because I've never known it until i knew you.
<br/><br/>
i would die for you. i had always thought about the concept of sacrificing myself and i always knew i would never actually do it but at some point when i so desperately just wanted to make things better for you and looking to God, i thought about it and i actually felt at peace with it. i give you my life and i would really give my life for you.
<br/><br/>
it eerily reminds me of blossom. <span class="green">I'll wish that I'll find the faith / I'll die and I'll save your place.</span> and my desire too, <span class="green">I'll write you another life / I'm sorry for crying / it's just that i love you.</span> remember how i cried first hearing this song because i had never felt that way about a person before. and then i felt that way about you. and it all kept getting more and more specific. and now i cry hearing this song because its about you and i love you and I'm sorry for crying. and now every song is about you, Says It, Shiwa, even fucking Cat and Dog.
<br/>
<br/>
i would die for you. but its too soon. i want to do laundry and taxes with you. i want to grow old with you. when one of us passes, i want both of us to smile, i want us to smile with lots of wrinkles because we lived a long, full, loving life together. and <span class="green">I'll be happy just to have known you.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
and i feel like i rely way too much on sharing songs with you and using their words. i dont have the words myself and all i can do is string together what i can, say what i can, do what i can, use lyrics, be there for you, and cry.

<br/><br/>
there were so many things i wanted to give you, show you, say to you for our anniversary, and a lot of them ended up coming early. but i think thats kind of symbolic of our relationship. when we were in our lets just be friends era, i chose that thinking it wasnt the right time, that i wasnt ready for a relationship. when we had our first kiss you had to grab me by the face because i kept waiting for some perfect moment. there were plenty more things we thought would come later that came earlier. i spilled that i love you just a few weeks into our relationship. i bought my necklace back in november knowing i would one day get to show it to you, and i did 7 months later though I thought itd be a lot longer. when i took my shahada it was earlier than i thought i would but i had found that there was no magical time to wait for. what i learned is, with the right person, there isnt a right time for anything, except the time we're in now. i cant wait to tell you i love you and how much i love you, its something you need to know every day. 
<br/><br/>
ive been more emotional and clingy recently and didnt really know why, but maybe its because i know that today i have you. 
<br/><br/>
and i dont know what tomorrow brings but i know I'll love you and I'll love you more each day. 
<br/><br/>
and i should tell you that love but i dont know how other than my 5 words and to hold onto you and to cry. 
<br/><br/>
<span class="green">I'm sorry for crying. It's just that I love you.</span>
