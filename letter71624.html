                  Dear Neemo,
                </strong>
                <p>
                  So it's been a year. Does it feel like it went by really fast, or does it feel more like we've spent a lifetime together? Would either of us thought, a year ago, that we'd be here today?
                  <br><br>
                  One fateful encounter. One fateful butterfly. One more fateful day.
                  <br><br>
                  We've looked back a lot at where we started and before, and looking back, it's always been a miracle that we've foudn our way here. I'm truly blessed.
                  <br><br>
                  In these 365 days, I've come to know love, care, comfort, warmth, and happiness, all at your hand.
                  <br><br>
                  We've looked back a lot. But I'm going to ask now darling that we start looking forward instead. I look forward to seeing you more every day and creating new memories and mew moments with you. I look forward to new moments that are better than looking back. Because dear,
                  <br><br>
                  Every moment I spend with you is my favorite moment.
                  <br><br>
                  So I'll keep falling more in love with you every day. I'll keep making sandwiches and onigiri and eggs. I'll keep writing you letters. Please look forward to it dear.
                </p>
                <p class='sincerely'>
                Love, Remi
