                  Dear Neemo,
                </strong>
                <p>
i told you that if i came back and you're gone, that i would look for you. and you said what if you're really gone, like gone gone. and i said i would keep looking for you and i wouldn't stop until i found you.
<br><br>
i lied.
<br><br>
because even when i find you i won't stop looking for you every day. i want to spend every day with you, i want to always find you again and again. if you were really gone gone, i know i would still find you and i would find you every day. in every gentle breeze, in every ray of sunshine, in every flower, in every butterfly, in every bird's song, in every laugh, in every smile, in every act of kindness. i'd find you. 
<br><br>
again and again.
<br><br>
<br><br>
don't die.
                </p>
                <p class='sincerely'>
                Love, Remi
